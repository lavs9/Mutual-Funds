# RTA Integration

## RTA

RTA is Registrar and Transfer Agents who are essentially the book keepers of AMCs. The need for a separate RTA to manage the operations of AMC comes from regulatory perspective. SEBI can control,  implement and monitor the RTAs specifically and hence plays a major role in keeping fraud activities in check. 

### RTAs in India

* CAMS
* KARVY
* ~~Franklin :~~ Now merged with CAMS
* ~~Sundaram :~~ Now merged with Karvy

### Pre-requisite to Integrations

1. Need to ensure that you have applied for registration at both RTAs as **Channel Partner**  Mode. 
2. Keep a generic email rather than personal emails of the company for registration. 
3. Make generic Login credentials for RTAs. 
4. Agreement with AMCs as channel partner.
